# GladiatorOnline

GladiatorOnline is an Unreal Engine 4 mobile game currently in early stages of development. The idea is a 1v1 multiplayer turn based fighting game. Players will create and customise their own Gladiator to enter the Arena with. Once they enter the Arena they will have to make their way through 8~ matchmade fights before their Gladiator is 'freed' and they are succesful. Each fight won will allow them to upgrade their Gladiator's weapons, spells, armour and stats. If they lose, their Gladiator is slain and they be required to make a new Gladiator for their next run.

## Project Setup/Install

1. Compile Unreal Engine 4.24.3 from Source
2. Include PlayFab SDK 4.24 and Swipe 4.24 in Engine/Plugin
3. Install free Paragon Heroes from Marketplace.
4. The project should be ready to go.

## Monetisation

Skins are the main method of monetisation, people will be able to buy new skins for weapons, armour, etc.

There will be a mode that will require an entry fee, which will allow people to stake money on their survival. If they make it past a break even point of wins they will be refunded their entry fee in in-game currency, anything past that and they will make a profit on the entry fee.

Ads will also be present to those who have not bought anything in the shop.

## Combat

Turn based fighting game. Have combos and other interesting things, perhaps have certain iniative checks, i dunno.
